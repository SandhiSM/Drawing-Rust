# About these folders

These folders are essential to the execution of this application; even if they appear to contain nothing at first glance, they will always contain files somewhere in the course of the program.
Please keep in mind that if you delete these folders, the application will not run.
If you have deleted the files - and this text may have been deleted as well :( - then create the folders yourself or download them again; of course, the data will be deleted, so if you don't want to lose your data, make a backup; however, if you delete everything, you won't have a backup either.
**Well, in short, don't mess with anything. :)**
